        //install_dir\api\redist\CLR2. These interops were created using Microsoft .NET Framework Version 2.0. Use them in your SOLIDWORKS VSTA (VB.NET and C#) macros.
        //install_dir\api\redist. These interops were created using Microsoft .NET Framework Version 4.0. Use them in your SOLIDWORKS add-ins (VB.NET and C#).
